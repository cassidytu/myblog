The hex color values for each of the colored swatches shown for the product was documented. Then, using Adobe Photoshop, the lightness value of each color (using the CIE Lab color model) was extracted.\n I created two sorted datasets from The Pudding’s dataset that organized the brands according to groups (also creating a new column that separated each brand by country). One of the datasets (sorted_shades) I had cleaned consists of only the darkest and lightest shade offered by each brand, as this was the primary data I focused on for visualizations through several sources in their home countries. \nThroughout the project, I will be primarily focusing on the lightness value and plotting out the lightest and darkest shade each brand offers reveals how extensive their range is."

    "text": "Discussion\nOverall, the question being asked is how inclusive and diverse are beauty brands around the world, in regards to skin tones and foundation shade ranges?  We can see that there is a large discrepancy between the visualizations, of the “Lightest” and “Darkest” Foundation Shade of Each Brand, between the top and bottom beauty brand. This reveals that many of these cosmetic companies do not cater to darker skin tones, but have no issue providing shades for lighter skinned consumers. Offering a darker shade range is far and few, typically only seen in US beauty brands but more specifically BIPOC-recommended brands led by BIPOC founders.  However, in the “Foundation Range Distribution Around the World” visualization, we see that most of the countries in the dataset (the US, Japan, and India) skew towards providing more shade ranges for lighter rather than darker tones. I would like to acknowledge that the availability of foundation shades are often based on the demand of consumers and that certain countries have varying skin tone ranges (like Nigeria in comparision to Japan). However, considering societal standards of beauty (and other various factors that contribute to it) and the common trend towards catering to lighter skin tones in more diverse countries like the US, the limited shade avaliability is still of concern. The various visualizations in this project supports the answer that beauty brands around the world have much more work to get closer to a more inclusive and diverse, as there is a lack of darker shade ranges needed to combat the prejudice that beautiful skin is lighter skin."
