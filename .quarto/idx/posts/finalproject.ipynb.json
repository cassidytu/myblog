The data explores and analyzes the characteristics of these shade ranges to learn more about shade availability from beauty brands in the US and around the world. Here, the project seeks to investigate the diversity and inclusion (or lack of) in foundation products.\n\n### Research Question:\n*How inclusive and diverse are beauty brands around the world?:* In regards to foundation shade ranges\n\n### Motivation:\nPeople of color often face a lack of diversity and inclusivity in society, from education to entertainment and the beauty industry is no exemption. Many major beauty brands create products that fail to cater to users who have darker skintones, with a limited range and a lack variations in undertones. Inclusivity and accessibility for darker skintones is the bare minimum for beauty brands that seems to be non-existent, unfortunately.\n\n### Source:\n*Dataset:* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/makeup-shades-dataset\n<br>\n\n## Data\n### Summary:\nThis dataset represents the shade ranges of foundation offered by beauty brands around the world.\n<br> <br>\nA list of \"best seller\" beauty brands in the US, Nigeria, India, and Japan was curated, verified through several sources in their home countries. During May 2018, each brand's website was visited and the liquid foundation line that (at the time of our sampling) had the largest number of shades available was selected to be recorded. The hex color values for each of the colored swatches shown for the product was documented. Then, using Adobe Photoshop, the lightness value of each color (using the CIE Lab color model) was extracted.
